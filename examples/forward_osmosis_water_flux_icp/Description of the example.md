# forward_osmosis_water_flux_icp #

This example returns the maximum water flux through a membrane under the following circumstances:

*Flux is only affected by osmotic pressure, internal concentration polarization (ICP) of solutes (membrane configuration dependent, like AL:DS or AL:FS) and diffusive leakage of solution molecules from draw to feed.

## Usage
A build script *buildtask_gcc.cmd* is included in this folder. On Windows, you can use it to compile 
the example. Alternatively, you can open the build script, look for the compilation statements and compile it manually.

## What do I see

You will see values representing water flux under varying membrane specifications.
