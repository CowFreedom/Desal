REQUIRES NVCC Compiler

This example simulates Navier Stokes flow on a rectangular grid.

More details concerning the computation can be found in the supplied PDF document.

## Usage
A build script *buildtask_gcc.cmd* is included in this folder. On Windows, you can use it to compile 
the example. Alternatively, you can open the build script, look for the compilation statements and compile it manually.

## What do I see

You will see fluid flow. If you don't do anything, this flow is static.
Clicking on the render window and dragging the mouse induces a (fluid) current.
