# Desal #

**Desal** provides various algorithms useful for modeling osmosis processes.

* Allows simulation of fluid flux with respect to internal contentration polarization (ICP), salt accumulation and fouling
* **No dependencies** to external libraries

A thorough description of the implementation of some algorithms can be found on [keinefirma.xyz](keinefirma.xyz/documents/fluid_tutorial).

## Installation
Build scripts are included to build the software. Currently, for the coprocessor acceleration
CUDA is used. It has been tested on MSVC v16.8.4 and GCC 11.2. Please note that your compiler
should be C++ Modules compliant.

## Examples
Besides the examples below, there is an examples folder in this repository.
The files are doxygen ready.
